Actions to stop doing
• Being late to meetings

Actions to start doing
• Go over the code we wrote to make sure that it follows the style guide
• Remove any uneccesary code, like print statements, to clean up the code
	
Actions to keep doing
• Keep communicating effectively with team members 
• Helping each other out in tasks we are having trouble with

Work Completed
• Give users the ability to edit the “cards” in their scrum board
• Assign specific “cards” to group members
• Have the ability to change the color of the “cards” (basic colors)
• “Cards” can be moved within their own column or to another column. Any changes in the scrum board will be updated to the database
• Add ability to add new columns, change column name and delete columns
• Add ability to add new tasks
• Create a modal which will allow users to delete / edit tasks
• When the user creates a new board they will be taken to an empty scrum board where they can start adding cards
• In order for users to go back later and work on their boards they need to click on “My Scrum Boards” and they will see  all the boards they are associated with. Users can then click on any of their boards and be taken to that specific board
• Remove “My Scrum Board” tab in the sidebar since Professor’s won’t be creating scrum boards
• Create a tab in the Professor’s project Pane that navigates to myscrum.html. Professor’s can view all the scrum boards associated with a specific project
