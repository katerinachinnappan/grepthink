Goal
Our goal is to finish implementing the Scrum Board framework.

Task listing, organized by user story
  * User Story 1: As a user I want the ability to edit “cards” in my scrum board
     * Task 1: Give users the ability to edit the “cards” in their scrum board (5 hours)
     * Task 2: Assign specific “cards” to group members (5 hours)
     * Task 3: Have the ability to change the color of the “cards” (basic colors) (6 hours)
     * Task 4: “Cards” can be moved within their own column or to another column. Any changes in the scrum board will be updated to the        database (6 hours)
        Total Hours: ~22 hours

  * User Story 2: As a developer I want to show user’s their boards in myscrum.html
     * Task 1: When the user creates a new board they will be taken to an empty scrum board where they can start adding cards (5 hours)
     * Task 2: In order for users to go back later and work on their boards they need to click on “My Scrum Boards” and they will see     all the boards they are associated with. Users can then click on any of their boards and be taken to that specific board (6 hours)
        Total Hours: ~11  hours
 
  * User Story 2: As the Professor I want to see student’s scrum boards but cannot make any modifications
     * Task 1: Remove “My Scrum Board” tab in the sidebar since Professor’s won’t be creating scrum boards (1 hour)
     * Task 1: Create a tab in the Professor’s project Pane that navigates to myscrum.html. Professor’s can view all the scrum boards associated with a specific project (3 hours)
     * Task 2: Give the Professor read access to student scrum boards but not write access (5 hours)
